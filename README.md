<h2>Goal:</h2>
<p>
In some operating systems, there is no persian calender, so in this <br> 
repository a graphical app has been created to show current jalali <br>
date and time(persian date and time).
</p>

<h2>Packages:</h2>
<p>
1-jdatetime: to get jalali date and time. <br>
2-pyside6: to create a gui(based on QT6). <br>
3-convert_numbers: to convert english numbers to persian. <br>
4-pyinstaller: to create an executable app in your OS (that's up to you) <br>
and if you don't need this package, just remove it from <br>
"requirements.txt" file before install the packages.  
</p>

<h2>How to run?</h2>
<p>1-install python3 (at the moment Im using version 3.10) and pip.</p>
<p>2-install the packages named in file "requirements.txt":</p>
<h4>command line: pip3 install -r requirements.txt</h4>	
<p>3- run the "execute.py" file.</p>
